# Smart-Agriculture-with-data-driven-IoT
This project was built in order to revolutionize the traditional farming technology. 
The smart agriculture monitoring system deals with multiple sensors communicating in a network.
The Internet of Things (IoT) system is powered by ESP8266 (Node MCU) microcontroller
embedded with temperature sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, gas sensor and Water pump
motor. The system provides message alerts after receiving data through the sensors and the whole
system can be controlled through the common mobile application. The real-time data sensed by
different sensors is displayed into an android app. Within a button click, the farmer can control the
light system and the motor in agriculture field from remote access. When the soil is dry the water
pump motor activates itself until the moisture limit is achieved.
